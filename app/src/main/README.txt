I added a test button to the top right, so we can test activities while they are being developed, without actually having to put them in a logical position.
These are located in SignInActivity.java, and AllRewardsActivity.java,
just ctrl+f for
action_test.
The top right button has a test, list, which you can use to well. test things.
